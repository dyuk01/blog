## Problem
![alt text](/blog/public/img/BuyStock.png)

## Approach
This may seem like finding the max value, but the fact that we cannot sell before buying makes this problem difficult.

1. Initialize buying and selling variable to 0 and 1 to ensure we don't sell before buying the stock
2. By initializing two values (current and max profit), we can always acquire the  
max value for each iteration.

## Code
```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        # Buy
        left = 0
        # Sell
        right = 1
        # Return value
        max_profit = 0
        # Prevent Out of bound
        while right < len(prices) :
            # Current value to compare with max_profit
            curr_profit = prices[right] - prices[left]
            # Ensure we don't sell before buying
            if prices[left] < prices[right] :
                # Find the max profit
                max_profit = max(curr_profit, max_profit)
            else :
                # Move buy element to the next element
                left = right
            # Move the selling day by 1
            right += 1
        return max_profit
```
