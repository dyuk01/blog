## Problem
![alt text](/blog/public/img/ZigzagConversion.png)

## Approach


## Code
```python
        
```

## Time Complexity
O(n)
> strip, split, reverse, and join function all runs for O(n) because they all iterate through each character in the array only once. Thus, the length of n in total. O(n) + O(n) + O(n) + O(n) = O(4n), which simplifies to O(n)

## Space Complexity
O(1)
> Because s was given as an input, modifying s to return as a output value does not impact the space complexity
