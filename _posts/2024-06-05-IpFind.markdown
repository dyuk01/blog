## Procedure
1. Download nmap library using terminal
```bash
pip3 install python-nmap
```
2. Download the <a href="https://nmap.org/download" target="_blank">nmap package</a> as well. Since this package does not get recognized by mac itself, user must allow the application to download from System Settings > Privacy & Security > Security.
3. First, user can recognize their own IP address via the command below.
```bash
ipconfig getifaddr en0  
```
4. Then, acquire the first 6 letters from the given IP address. If address was given as xxx.xxx.xx.xxx for example, acquire first 6 digits and type the command below.
```bash
nmap -sP xxx.xxx.0.0/24  
```  
-sP : "Ping Scan" option that nmap sends ping to determine which hosts are up on the designated network.  
/24 : Type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing" target="_blank">CIDR</a> notation, which represents subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. This means the command will scan all 256 IP address of the designated IP address
5. The following command is given to see the MAC address for each corresponding IP address for device.
```bash
arp -a
```
