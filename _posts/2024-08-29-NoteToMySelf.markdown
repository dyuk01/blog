## Issue
As my applications are approaching, I want to transition from using Python 2 to Python 3 and shift from LeetCode to VSCode. Python 2 is no longer serviced, and leveraging VSCode will offer more flexibility for coding from scratch. This change will help me stay updated with the latest Python features and ensure I can code and test more freely.
