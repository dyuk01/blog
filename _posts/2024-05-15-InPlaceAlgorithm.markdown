## Definition
In-place algorithm is an algorithm that transforms input using a small, constant amount of extra storage space.  
Usually, the extra storage space is used during the swap stage to keep track of the current variable.

## Characteristics
- Constant Space Complexity
> In-place algorithm typically uses O(1) space
- Data Modification
> Input data is directly modified without requiring any additional memory
- Efficiency 
> In-place algorithms are memory efficient, making them suitable for large data sets or  
codes with limited memory storage

## Pros

## Cons

## Examples of In-Place Algorithms
### Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
> Swaps elements in the same array
- Insertion Sort
> Shifts elements within the array
- Selection Sort
> Swaps elements within the array
- Quick Sort
> Recursively sorts the elements

### Array Manipulation
- Reversing an Array
> Swaps elements from both ends moving towards the center
- In-place Rotation
> Rotates elements within the array

## Time Complexity

## Space Complexity
