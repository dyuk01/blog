## When to use
Whenever utilizing keys--such as API or openAI source--to use in open-source/public projects, we need to make sure no one else can access the keys to prevent any damage.

## Procedure

1. Make .gitignore file
> This tells github to ignore the noted files

2. Create a file('config.py') that contains API keys.
> Does not have to be config.py. Freely rename the file

```python
# .gitignore should include reference to config.py
api_key = "YOUR_KEY"
api_secret = "YOUR_SECRET"
access_token = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
token_secret = "YOUR_TOKEN_SECRET"
```

3. Write the file name that you want to ignore in .gitignore file

```bash
config.py
```

4. Import the api_key to the main project

```python
import config

api_key = config.api_key
```
