## Approach
Complicated version of <a href="https://dyuk01.github.io/blog/leetcode/string/array/python/easy/2024/05/17/BuyStock.html">Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock</a> problem, but the difference is the problem is asking for the maximum profit, which indicates that a user can buy and sell multiple times to find the highest profit that one can get.  

1. Initialize

## Code
```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        sum = 0
        for i in range(len(prices)-1) :
            if (prices[i] < prices[i+1]) :
                sum = sum + prices[i+1] - prices[i]
        return sum 
```
## Time Complexity
O(n)
> Loop runs n times

## Space Complexity
O(1)
> Constant amount of extra space is used
