## When to use
1. Useful when searching pairs in a sorted array or linked list
2. It will feature problems where you deal with sorted arrays/Linked Lists and need to find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints
3. The set of elements in the array is a pair, a triplet, or even a subarray

## How it works
Sliding window is used to perform a required operation on a specific window size of a given array or linked list.  
> 1. Start from 1st element and keep shifting by 1 element to the right
  2. Ajust the length of the window according to the problem
