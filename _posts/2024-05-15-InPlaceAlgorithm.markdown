## Definition
In-place algorithm is an algorithm that transforms input using a small, constant amount of extra storage space.  
Usually, the extra storage space is used during the swap stage to keep track of the current variable.

## Approach


## Code
```python

```
## Time Complexity

## Space Complexity
